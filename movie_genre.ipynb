In reality, America is backing Chiang's utterly corrupt regime in the belief that the Generalissimo is bound to win a Civil War. But Mao is also looking West, towards America. Rittenberg becomes directly involved in these secret overtures. He dreams of becoming a bridge between America a new China. But nobody in Washington is really listening. In scenes with General Marshall and President Truman we see how America stumbled yet again into a disastrous foreign policy blunder. Rittenberg treks north, to Mao's base in Yan'an. He meets Mao. Mao gives him a job. He also hooks up again with Yulin. They fall in love. They marry. Civil War erupts. Rittenberg and Yulin are with Mao as he inflicts defeat after defeat on Chiang's forces. America has backed the wrong horse. As Mao's army claims victory and the Generalissimo flees the country, Rittenberg's dream is still alive. He is ordered to Beijing. He believes that this is his moment. It's a cruel deception. After America had ignored Mao's overtures, the Chinese saw no choice but to renew their old alliance with the Russians. On orders from Moscow, Rittenberg is arrested as an American spy. He experiences for himself the dark and deadly side of the movement to which he has pledged his full allegiance: the nightmare of the Chinese Communist penal system. On Stalin's death, in 1953, Rittenberg is released. He stays in China. He stays with Yulin. All this is true. It is historical fact. And Sidney Rittenberg is still going strong, at 93 - a living witness to the revolution that changed the world and that we see, in this movie, for the first time, from a completely fresh perspective.\",\n",

A view of Memorial Drive moves to Storrow, gliding around the harbor to Back Bay and finally resting at the colorful lights of the North End waterfront, where the sky is slowly illuminating with the glow of dawn. Al (Aly) Gianetti, a traditional Italian man approaching middle age, lies sleeping with his beautiful live-in girlfriend Gianna. As they softly awaken, their deep loving rest will soon be replaced with the frantic routine of Al\\'s chosen career path. Al, an intense, bohemian actor with a brash, sarcastic sense of humor, is rushing out the door to attend a casting call where he will meet Cinthia (Cin). Meanwhile, we parallel the hurried preparations of Cin leaving her home for the same casting call. A pretty, well-organized, 30-something formally trained stage actress, Cinthia juggles her baby in one arm and her script in the other while bickering with her husband in this typical morning scene. Al introduces himself to Cinthia in the casting company waiting room, and despite their polar-opposite backgrounds and personalities, they are quickly drawn to each other. They begin to spend more time together, and in sharing common career goals and opening doors within themselves, the two strengthen their kinship as struggling actors in Boston. Long conversations and secret trysts, severe clashes and moments of undeniable chemistry reveal the complimentary nature of the two actors, both finding a passion in this relationship that is missing in their normal lives. At home, Al is the divorced father of 16-year-old Annalisa, who in her teenage vulnerability has fallen into a relationship with local street thug Tonio. Al constantly worries about his daughter, who is spending more and more time with Tonio and his gang. Additionally, there is a void growing between Al and Gianna, as she senses that he is becoming distracted and distant. Similar feelings of worry and mistrust can be found at Cinthia\\'s house. Cin\\'s husband Ben continues to express his disapproval of the unpredictable and unreliable lifestyle that her career has forced upon her, and their three-year-old daughter Brittney rarely sees her mother anymore. Each of these conflicts is unwittingly reinforced by Al and Cin\\'s behavior, all of the emotional ups and downs rapidly escalating in raging intensity. In the end, both must accept the responsibility of making a choice that may be acceptable, but is difficult and vague of heart.',\n",

Intrepid photographer Alexandra de Steiguer embraces five cold months of solitude year after year on a remote island group miles off the coast of Maine in her role as winter caretaker.

This madcap documentary reexamines the Cultural Revolution and restores the once bright reputation of Mao Zedong. \"The Passion of the Mao\" begins by correcting misconceptions about Mao\\'s early years. Unlike the tyrants with whom he is usually compared, Mao was a successful scholar and businessman before he became a rabble-rouser. By the mid1950s, he had unified China, spurred an impressive rate of growth, restructured the education system, and improved living standards. Then he became a Maoist. Mao devoted the rest of his life to eliminating the centralized Soviet bureaucracy he and his colleagues had built. The film takes viewers back to the 1960s. Successful women and men, some now professors at major universities in the West, credit Mao and especially the Cultural Revolution for making them feminists and allowing them access to education. During the Cultural Revolution, Mao brought Western-style ballets and operas, reinterpreted in Chinese form, to China\\'s villages. Peasants chose leaders who represented their true interests, and rural communities built schools independent of the central government. And what about the anti-Maoist beliefs that have sullied the reputation of the man once referred to as \"the sun in the sky?\" They are part of a vast radical conspiracy, the result of propaganda churned out by the same people who turned the tanks on the Tiananmen demonstrators.',\n",

It was a daunting task to find harmony in a semi-abstract film and accompanying music. The film is striving for the way of finding perfect harmony for every color through a precisely calculated shape it represented. Film directors, especially with artistic background, know how crucial is the understanding of the scale of a colors in a film frame composition. There is a high degree of complexity in proportions and correspondence with the other colors in one mise en scčne; the shape visible in yellow will become color indifferent if depicted in green, i.e. an object that is perfect in yellow, will be read as secondary, and grayed out in human perception, if painted in a different color. Moving Painting film series project has reference to a long track in history of visual arts in exploration of correlation of music and shape animation. Most famous examples include Viking Eggeling, \"Diagonal Symphony\", \"Space Modulator\" by László Moholy-Nagy [c 1942]., \"DREITEILIGE FARBSONATINE\" (1923) by Ludwig Hirschfeld-Mack, Oskar Fischinger with his \\'Sound Scrolls\\', Ballet Mécanique (1924) by Fernand Léger It was fascinating to invent the ways of illustrating music in film, to animate an image based on parameters of a different media - music.

On the morning of the attacks, hundreds of hours of military and air traffic control conversations were captured on tape painting a chilling and tragic picture of events spiraling inexorably out of control. With events unfolding at breakneck-speed, the tapes reveal in minute-by-minute detail, the chaos and confusion wrought by the attacks. Revelations include how Air Force fighter jets, scrambled to protect Washington, set out in the wrong direction - ending up 60 miles out across the Atlantic ocean and that permission to shoot down hijacked passenger planes only came through after the last plane crashed. And while air traffic controllers watched the second plane crash into the World Trade Center tower, fighter jets were still 100 miles away from New York and amid all the confusion it took 39 minutes for the news of United 93's hijack to reach the military. With testimonies from the people who appear on the tapes, the film vividly conveys the emotion, courage and panic in the voices of air traffic controllers and military personnel whose job it was to protect America as it came under attack.\",\n",

It went viral with over 15 million hits, and instantly launched her as the poster child against privileged young white women volunteering overseas. In Tanzania we follow a new intake of western volunteers as they travel, party and volunteer. Among them are untrained medical volunteers, eager for experience, who tackle procedures beyond their training or ability, potentially putting a patient's life at risk. In Cambodia, former U.K. Police Detective Eric Meldrum and investigative reporter Juliana Ruhfus show the link between the volunteers working in orphanages, and the exploitation of the very children they have come to help. In an Ecuador animal refuge, we see a profit-driven voluntourism company preying on volunteers' good intentions. Volunteers Unleashed shows dramatically that going overseas with good intentions, does not guarantee good will be done. Inspired by his daughter Jennica's life-changing experience as a volunteer in Tanzania in 2012, Vancouver filmmaker Brad Quenville (The Dolphin Dealer, Ice Pilots, Pyros, Highway Thru Hell) went back to Africa with his daughter and DOP Kyle Sandilands to shoot and develop the documentary.\",\n",

I contacted William Markle, a local New York Cinematographer, and asked him if he had an interest in creating a documentary, in partnership with me, about a day in the life of a pornographer. He jumped at the chance. In 1972 porno was all the rage, and we thought that a documentary, or docudrama about the making of XXX rated films might just be successful at the box office. The actors who participated in the shooting of the loops were: Myself, Harry Reems, Fred Lincoln, Lucy Grantham, Sargeant Tina, and several Gypsies.

I wrote a story about a film maker, who was making porno on the side, unbeknownst to Mrs. Film maker. We Hired an actress/belly dancer named Cathy Joyce to play my wife, and shot the script I had written. We intercut the new dramatized scenes of the film maker and his wife with the original documentary footage of the making of porno loops, and the result was a feature length docudrama, or docucomedy called \"LOOPS\". In the Fall of 1972 Bill Markle and I began the process of screening our project for potential distributors. Everybody saw it; MGM, Avco Embassy, Columbia, Paramount, Warners. Heady times for a couple of young film makers. In the end none of the majors had the guts to pull the trigger on this kind of project. We came close with Warners, but they finally decided against it. During one of the screenings, Sean Cunningham (Last House On the Left, Friday the Thirteenth)began weeping. He saw \"LOOPS\" as the story of his life, right down to having the same first name as the main character. (Me) So Bill and I sold the picture to Cunningham. The sale figure didn\\'t exactly break the bank, but it was way more than it cost to make so Bill and I were Happy. After some re-shooting and re-editing, Cunningham opened \"LOOPS\" to mixed reviews and pretty negative box office. This movie seems to have completely disappeared from the face of the earth. In the mid Seventies \"LOOPS\" was in the archives of the Lincoln Center Film Society, but since then has fallen through the cracks.

The documentary elucidates both the staggering scale of the refugee crisis and its profoundly personal human impact.

Human Flow is a witness to its subjects and their desperate search for safety, shelter and justice: from teeming refugee camps to perilous ocean crossings to barbed-wire borders; from dislocation and disillusionment to courage, endurance and adaptation; from the haunting lure of lives left behind to the unknown potential of the future. Human Flow comes at a crucial time when tolerance, compassion and trust are needed more than ever.

The show follows Egypt, a contemporary chic Southern Californian whose relentless search for spiritual and mental enlightenment never ends. With the help of her friends, all of whom can read each other\\'s thoughts (also accompanied by her Shaman, Harry Paul only visible to her), she approaches her goal of perfecting her higher-self with all the vigor one might expect from an artist in the uber-liberal landscape of modern day Los Angeles. However, due to her most human qualities, and comedic sensibilities that invoke the essence of Lucille Ball and Carol Burnett type silliness, she sometimes falls short of the perfection that she seeks. And while these failings to attain true oneness and synchronicity with the universe probably make her more complete as an individual and the higher being that she aspires to be, she\\'ll never stop trying to have all of her spiritual ducks in a neat little row. Of course this will never happen, but that is precisely the journey that the audience can laugh at and relate to. Another aspect of Egypt\\'s world, is her love and respect of culture and fashion. Both of which are manifestations of her love for life and her unending quest for beauty in the world, and this becomes abundantly clear when we get to know the people that surround her. Holly, her best friend and co-conspirator in all things ethereal, shares this keen sense of art and fashion which often becomes apparent in their \"shared\" thoughts and jokes. All of her female friends participate in this shared-mind convention that drives the comedy of the show, but Holly\\'s thoughts are most closely related to Egypt\\'s and their similar sensibilities and goals reinforce that throughout the show.

A typical American family car for an atypical American family, it provides the women at first with all the familiar comforts. But when their relationship ends, the car becomes the property of one woman and the bane of the other's existence. Even long after their separation, this tangible reminder of their life together--and thousands of its imitators--continues to prowl the streets of the city, haunting the woman who no longer holds the keys either to the car or the other woman's heart. Rules of the Road is also study in theme and variations. In this case, the theme is the standard wagon. The variations are a consequence of experience, which transforms the object and makes us continually invest it with new meanings. This sense of constant change happens during the course of the film just as surely as it happens to us in our daily lives.

From regal burial, to exhumation and decapitation, this relic of our only non-royal ruler has traveled a most peculiar path. It has been a gruesome warning to traitors, a secret prize for a soldier, an attraction at an 18th century peep show, and an object of veneration and derision, until it was finally laid to rest in a secret ceremony.
